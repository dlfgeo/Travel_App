<!-- History -->\
New York City traces its origins to [[Fort Amsterdam]] and a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonists]] in approximately 1624. The settlement was named [[New Amsterdam]] (\{\{lang-nl|[[:nl:Nieuw-Amsterdam (Nieuw-Nederland)|Nieuw Amsterdam]]|link=yes\}\}) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under [[British colonization of the Americas|English control]] in 1664 and was renamed New York after King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted the lands to his brother, the [[James II of England|Duke of York]].<ref name="npsnetherland" /> The city was temporarily regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange; however, the city has been named New York since November 1674.
