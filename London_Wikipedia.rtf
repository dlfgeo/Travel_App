==Toponymy==\
\{\{main|Etymology of London\}\}\
''London'' is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form \{\{lang|la|[[Londinium]]\}\}.<ref name=":2">\{\{Cite book |last=Mills |first=Anthony David |title=A Dictionary of London Place Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=9780192801067 |pages=139|oclc=45406491\}\}</ref> Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: [[Latin]] (usually \{\{lang|la|Londinium\}\}), [[Old English]] (usually \{\{lang|ang|Lunden\}\}), and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (usually \{\{lang|cy|Llundein\}\}), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from [[Common Brittonic|Common Brythonic]]; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as \{\{lang|cel-x-proto|*Londonjon\}\} or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as \{\{lang|la|Londinium\}\} and borrowed into Old English.<ref name="auto">\{\{Cite journal |last1=Bynon |first1=Theodora |year=2016 |title=London's Name |journal= Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=281\'9697 |doi=10.1111/1467-968X.12064\}\}</ref>\

Until 1889, the name "London" applied officially only to the [[City of London]], but since then it has also referred to the [[County of London]] and to [[Greater London]].<ref>\{\{Cite book |last=Mills |first=David |title=A Dictionary of London Place Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=9780192801067 |pages=140 |oclc=45406491\}\}</ref>\

The [[Vikings]] applied [[Danelaw]] over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from London to [[Chester]] as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the [[Vikings|Viking]] incursions formally agreed by the [[Danes|Danish]] [[warlord]], [[Guthrum]] and the [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] king [[Alfred the Great]] in 886. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records that Alfred "refounded" London in 886.

\{\{main|Geography of London\}\}\
\
===Scope===\
London, also known as [[Greater London]], is one of nine [[regions of England]] and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The [[City of London]] at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its [[suburbs]], causing "London" to be defined several ways.<ref name="chancery">\{\{Cite book|last1=Beavan |first1=Charles|last2=Bickersteth|first2=Harry|title=Reports of Cases in Chancery, Argued and Determined in the Rolls Court|publisher=Saunders and Benning |year=1865 |url=https://archive.org/details/reportscasesinc14romigoog\}\}</ref>\

Modern London stands on the [[River Thames|Thames]], its primary geographical feature, a [[Navigability|navigable]] river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain|flood plain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. Historically London grew up at the [[lowest bridging point]] on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marsh]]lands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.<ref name=london_065>\{\{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&pg=PR11 |title=London: A History |first=Francis |last=Sheppard |page=10 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-285369-1 |access-date=6 June 2008\}\}</ref>\

Places within London's vast urban area are identified using area names, such as [[Mayfair]], [[Southwark]], [[Wembley]], and [[Whitechapel]].

[[File:Aerial Tower of London.jpg|thumb|The [[Tower of London]], a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078]]\
London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the [[National Gallery]], are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, these being a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period [[Hampton Court Palace]].<ref>\{\{cite book| author = Summerson, John | year = 1969| title = Great Palaces (Hampton Court. pp. 12\'9623)| publisher = Hamlyn| isbn = 9780600016823| url = https://archive.org/details/greatpalaces0000unse| author-link = John Summerson\}\}</ref>\
\
Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by [[Christopher Wren]], neoclassical financial institutions such as the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and the [[Bank of England]], to the early 20th century [[Old Bailey]] courthouse and the 1960s [[Barbican Estate]]. The 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of [[Victorian architecture]], most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]].<ref name=london_078>\{\{Cite web |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |title=Paddington Station |publisher=Great Buildings |access-date=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525164017/http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=dead\}\}</ref> The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]] and [[Canary Wharf]], high residential densities in [[inner London]], and lower densities in [[Outer London]].\

[[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]], respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] (built to commemorate [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Horatio Nelson]]) is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of central London.

In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as [[30 St Mary Axe]] (dubbed "The Gherkin"), [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]], are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and [[Canary Wharf]]. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct [[protected view]]s of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and other historic buildings.<ref name=Protected/> This protective policy, known as 'St Paul's Heights', has been in operation by the City of London since 1937.<ref name=Protected>\{\{cite news |title=Protected views and tall buildings |url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/planning/planning-policy/protected-views-and-tall-buildings |access-date=28 June 2022 |website=City of London.gov.uk\}\}</ref> Nevertheless, there are [[Tall buildings in London|a number of tall skyscrapers]] in central London, including the 95-storey [[Shard London Bridge]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United Kingdom|tallest building in the United Kingdom]] and Western Europe.<ref>\{\{cite news |title=Take a tour of The Shard's viewing platform |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-20979547 |access-date=16 June 2023 |agency=BBC\}\}</ref>\

London's [[wetland]] areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs), two [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]s and 76 [[List of local nature reserves in Greater London|local nature reserve]]s.<ref>\{\{Cite web |title=London Natural History Society \'96 Home |url=https://lnhs.org.uk/ |access-date=25 March 2021 |website=lnhs.org.uk\}\}</ref>\

==Transport==\
\{\{main|Transport in London|Infrastructure in London\}\}\
Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,<ref name=london_121>\{\{Cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ |title=Transport for London |publisher=Transport for London |access-date=27 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104235448/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ |archive-date=4 January 2010 |url-status=live\}\}</ref> but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the [[London Overground]] network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by [[Transport for London]] (TfL).<ref name="london_goverance"/>\
\
The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] or ''[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]'' was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].<ref name=stat_tfl>\{\{Cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055413/http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp |archive-date=19 October 2007 |title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority |access-date=5 June 2008 |url-status=dead\}\}</ref>\
